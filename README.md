SEARCH-BAR-W/LIST

**DISCLAIMER**

Thi project was, for me, a practice code-along project. You can find the Original creator on YouTube via searching 'Code Complete' YouTube Channel, video name: "Make a Search Bar with React" (with API Calls) Beginners Turtorial.

I did this to understand how exactly would I go about fetching data, 
and "if" an API would be needed in order to create a full functioning search component
for a bigger web application i am working on.

the answer is YES, even more, i would need to know more about APIs and How to create them, which has led
me to study python and this may take a while.
